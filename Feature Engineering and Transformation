                                               FEATURE ENGINEERING AND TRANSFORMATION
***********************************************************************************************************************************

-> WHAT IS FEATURE ENGINEERING?
   Creating new features or transforming the existing features to get the most out of your data.
   
-> CREATING NEW DATA:
   # Length of text field.
   # Percentage of charachters that are punctuation in the text
   # Percentage of the data that are Capitalized
   
-> TRANFORMATIONS :---> # Process that alters each data point in a certain column in a systematic way.
                        # If the distribution of the feature has the long right tail, Transformation aim to pull that tail in to 
                          make it a more compact distribution.
   # Power Transformatin (square, square root etc.)--------->

                                                                  Base of this transformation is y to the power of x, where y is the
                                                                  value in the individual cell and x is an exponent of the power 
                                                                  transformation.
   # Standardizing data - transforming all data on the same scale
   
   
-> TRANSFORMATION PROCESS :
         1. Determine what range of the exponents to test.
         2. Apply each transformation to each value of your choosen feature.
         3. Use some criteria to determine which of the transformations yield the best distribution.
         
         
-> While feature creation always imagine what information might be helpful in the model within the context and understanding of 
   what exactly it is trying to predict.
