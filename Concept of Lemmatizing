-> What is lemmatizing?

  # Process of grouping together the inflected forms of words so they can be analyzed as a single word, identified by the word's
   Lemma.
  # Using vocabulary analysis of words aiming to remove inflection endings to return the dictionary form of a word
  # ex-> type, typed, typing are of the same lemma called 'type', i.e. same word withe different tenses.
  
  
-> How lemmatizing is different from stemming?
  
  # Aiming same thing but in different ways- there is an accuracy and speed trade-off that you are making when you opt one over the 
    other
  # The goal of both is to condense derived words into their base forms
  
  # But practically--------------->
  
        Stemming is typically faster as it simply chops off the end of a word using heuristics, without understanding about the 
        context in which it is used. Because of this stemming may or may not return an actual word in the dictionary. It is less
        accurate but fast as the rules are quite simple.
        
        Lemmatizing is more accurate as it uses more informed analysis to create groups of words with similar meanings based on 
        the context around the word. It laverages more informed analysis. Always return a dictionary word. Due to additional 
        context it considered, it is more accurate but computationally more expensive
